# html-portfolio
This is my first portfolio website, created using only HTML. It showcases my journey as a beginner developer and provides a glimpse into my projects and interests. Though it's a humble beginning, I'm excited to share my progress and growth as I continue to learn and develop my skills in the world of web development.
